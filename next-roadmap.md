## üéØ Recommended Next Session Focus

**Start with #1: Enhanced Connection System**

This will have the biggest user impact and builds on the existing connection functionality. The chat system is now solid, so focusing on better roommate discovery and management makes sense.

**Session Goal**: Create an enhanced connections dashboard with filtering and management features.

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for a solid connection management system

## üìù Notes for Future Development

- **Chat system is production-ready** - no further work needed unless adding group features
- **Database schema supports group chats** - just need UI components  
- **WebSocket architecture is scalable** - can handle many more users
- **All migration files can be kept** - useful for future deployments

Great work on the chat overhaul! The foundation is now solid for building the rest of the app. üöÄ
