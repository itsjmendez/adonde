# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Adonde** is a roommate finder web application built with Next.js 15.4.6, using the App Router architecture, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui components. The app helps people find compatible roommates through location-based search, profile matching, and secure messaging.

### Core Features

- **User Authentication**: Email signup/login with verification
- **Profile Management**: Comprehensive profile setup and editing
- **Location-Based Search**: ✅ Find roommates by location with radius settings (COMPLETED)
- **Connection System**: Send/receive connection requests with accept/decline
- **Messaging**: ✅ Advanced real-time chat with clean UI and instant updates (COMPLETED)
- **Navigation System**: ✅ Modern sidebar navigation with WhatsApp-style chat interface (COMPLETED)
- **Layout System**: ✅ Fixed header/sidebar with independent content scrolling (COMPLETED)
- **Matching Algorithm**: Compatibility based on lifestyle preferences

## Development Commands

- **Start development server**: `npm run dev` (opens at http://localhost:3000)
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Start production server**: `npm start`
- **Lint code**: `npm run lint`

## Security Guidelines

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always check before committing files**

Before creating or committing any file, verify it doesn't contain:

- API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Hardcoded URLs (especially with project IDs)
- Database passwords or connection strings
- Internal system details that could aid attackers
- Migration files with sensitive schema information

**Files to NEVER commit:**

- Migration step files (`migration-step-*.md`)
- Production policies with hardcoded URLs
- Files containing database credentials
- API key configuration files
- Internal documentation with sensitive technical details

**Use `.gitignore`** for sensitive files that should remain local only.
